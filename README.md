# Stocks

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/stocks`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/executable` for an interactive prompt.

Welcome to the ruby Stocks CLI gem, where you can find all to information needed to maximize your investments!

Starting things off, you will be prompted by the program to enter a stock symbol to retrieve additional information about that specific stock, such as a company profile, current news, share prices, and more!

If you're like me and don't know every companies' stock symbol/ticker, you can enter 'ticker' when you start to retrieve a list of all the companies and their symbols that are on the US stock exchanges.

Stay tuned for more functionality in the near future incorporating company news, share prices, analysts reccomendations, and more!

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
