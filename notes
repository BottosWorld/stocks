Welcome to your Ruby CLI Project!

We are going to use the finnhub.io free API to put together a CLI around stocks!
API key - brm2kafrh5re8ma1q70g

The flow that is expected should appear as so..

    1. CLI welcomes the user with a greeting
    2. User is prompted to input a response:
        ** Type ticker if you would like to browse through a list of stocks.
        ** Type quote if you would like to see a stocks' price.
        ** Type profile if you would like a company profile of a stock.
    3. User is able to go back to main menu by typing "main menu".
    4. If user types "ticker", user will be shown a list of all stocks.
        ** Coming soon, user will have the option to enter a company name to show the ticker for that company **
    5. If user types "quote", user will be prompted to insert a stock symbol, ex "AAPL", and will receive a quote for pricing information.
    6. If user types "profile", user will be prompted to insert a stock symbol, ex "AAPL", to receive company information.
    7. If user types an invalid stock symbol, program should return "invalid symbol, try again".
    8. User should be able to exit the program by typing "exit" and the program will say, "Thank you, come again!"
